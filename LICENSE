## ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS

### SECURITY AND PRIVACY DISCLAIMER

This software implements advanced cryptographic functionality including:
- Signal Double Ratchet Protocol for end-to-end encryption
- X3DH key agreement protocol
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Elliptic curve cryptography (secp256k1, Ed25519)
- Peer-to-peer mesh networking
- Decentralized message routing

While **significant care** has been taken to follow cryptographic best practices
and industry standards:

1. **EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE**: This software is experimental and has not undergone
   formal third-party security audit or penetration testing.

2. **NO SECURITY GUARANTEE**: No warranty of security, privacy, anonymity, or
   protection against surveillance is provided or implied.

3. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Users assume all risks associated with using this
   software for sensitive, confidential, or critical communications.

4. **NOT FOR HIGH-RISK USE**: This software is NOT recommended for:
   - Life-threatening situations
   - Protection against nation-state adversaries
   - Critical infrastructure communications
   - Legal proceedings requiring certified secure communications
   - Any scenario where communication failure could cause serious harm

5. **KEY MANAGEMENT**: Users are solely responsible for:
   - Securing and backing up their cryptographic keys
   - Understanding that loss of keys results in permanent, irreversible loss of
     access to encrypted messages
   - Protecting their devices from unauthorized access
   - Maintaining operational security practices

6. **NETWORK SECURITY**: Mesh networking and peer-to-peer connections may expose:
   - Device presence and availability to nearby peers
   - Approximate geographic location through Bluetooth/WiFi discovery
   - Network traffic patterns to local network observers

7. **METADATA**: While message content is encrypted:
   - Timing of messages may be observable
   - Connection patterns between peers may be visible
   - IPFS fallback may expose some message routing metadata

8. **NO LIABILITY**: The developers, contributors, and maintainers are not
   responsible for any damages, losses, legal consequences, or security breaches
   resulting from the use of this software.

### CRYPTOGRAPHY NOTICE

This software contains cryptographic functionality that may be subject to legal
restrictions in certain jurisdictions:

1. **EXPORT CONTROL**: This software may be subject to export control laws in
   various countries, including but not limited to the United States Export
   Administration Regulations (EAR) and similar regulations in other jurisdictions.

2. **IMPORT RESTRICTIONS**: Some countries restrict the import, possession, use,
   and/or re-export of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software,
   users MUST check their country's laws, regulations, and policies.

3. **USER RESPONSIBILITY**: Users are solely responsible for:
   - Compliance with all applicable export control laws and regulations
   - Ensuring legal use in their jurisdiction
   - Obtaining necessary licenses or approvals
   - Understanding local restrictions on cryptographic software

4. **RESTRICTED COUNTRIES**: Users in countries with strict cryptographic
   controls (including but not limited to China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, North
   Korea, Syria, Cuba) should consult legal counsel before using this software.

### LEGAL COMPLIANCE

1. **LAWFUL USE**: This software is intended for lawful use only. Users must
   comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.

2. **PROHIBITED USES**: This software must NOT be used for:
   - Illegal activities or criminal conspiracy
   - Terrorist communications or planning
   - Human trafficking or exploitation
   - Drug trafficking or illegal commerce
   - Child exploitation or abuse
   - Violation of sanctions or embargoes
   - Any activity prohibited by applicable law

3. **TERMS OF SERVICE**: When using IPFS/Pinata cloud fallback features, users
   must comply with those services' terms of service and acceptable use policies.

4. **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**: Users must respect intellectual property rights
   and not use this software to infringe on copyrights, trademarks, patents,
   or trade secrets.

### TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS

1. **MESH NETWORKING**:
   - Requires physical proximity (Bluetooth range ~30-100m)
   - Dependent on peer availability
   - May experience delays in multi-hop routing
   - Not guaranteed to be available or reliable

2. **OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY**:
   - Messages may be delayed or fail to deliver
   - Recipient must eventually come online to receive messages
   - No guarantee of message delivery

3. **IPFS FALLBACK**:
   - Dependent on third-party infrastructure
   - May incur storage costs
   - Subject to IPFS network availability
   - Not truly peer-to-peer when fallback is used

4. **BATTERY AND PERFORMANCE**:
   - Mesh networking may significantly impact battery life
   - Background scanning and message checking consume resources
   - Large media files may cause performance issues

5. **COMPATIBILITY**:
   - iOS 15.0 or later required
   - May not work on older devices
   - Future OS updates may break functionality

### PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

While IHSOTAHS is designed with privacy in mind:

1. **DEVICE ACCESS**: The app requires access to:
   - Camera (for QR scanning and media)
   - Photos (for media sharing)
   - Bluetooth (for mesh networking)
   - Local Network (for WiFi Direct)

2. **DATA STORAGE**: Encrypted messages are stored locally on device

3. **CLOUD BACKUP**: Users should be aware that device cloud backups (iCloud)
   may include message data

4. **PEER DISCOVERY**: Using mesh networking makes your device discoverable
   to nearby peers

5. **NO ANONYMITY GUARANTEE**: While the app doesn't collect personal data,
   perfect anonymity is not guaranteed

### OPEN SOURCE TRANSPARENCY

This software is open source to enable:
- Community security review
- Independent verification of cryptographic implementation
- Transparency in functionality
- User trust through auditability

However:
- Open source does NOT guarantee security
- Code review by users is encouraged but not guaranteed
- Vulnerabilities may exist and be discovered over time
- Users should stay updated with latest security releases

### UPDATES AND MAINTENANCE

1. **NO GUARANTEE OF UPDATES**: The maintainers are not obligated to provide
   updates, bug fixes, or security patches.

2. **DEPRECATED FEATURES**: Features may be removed or changed without notice.

3. **BREAKING CHANGES**: Updates may not be backward compatible.

4. **USER RESPONSIBILITY**: Users must monitor for updates and security advisories.
